Solving linear optimization problems with CasADi:

- Worksheet 2, Excercise 2 (using an NLP-sovler)

- Worksheet 2, Excercise 2 (using a QP-sovler)

- Worksheet 2, Excercise 5 (using an NLP-sovler)

- Worksheet 3, Excercise 3 (using an NLP-sovler)

- Worksheet 5, Excercise 1 (using an NLP-solver; here, the transport problem is formulated as a liner optimization problem)
